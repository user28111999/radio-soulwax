      <h2>Welcome to <b><u>RADIO SOULWAX</u></b></h2>
      <p>
      Ok, so it's a radio station, but not as you know it. For now, it's a growing collection of 24 one hour-long mixes with visuals that we are sharing with you for free, and hopefully it will become a platform for many more things to come. We call them mixes, but in reality they are more like musical films based on the record sleeves.
      <br /><br />
      Every hour has a different musical and visual theme (always based on the covers), to eventually make for a varied day-long radio schedule that will remain online in a rotated and continuous loop.
      <br /><br />
      Over the next few months we will be adding a new show every week, culminating in a 24-hour musical and visual 'experience'. Sorry, we couldn't think of a better word than experience.
      <br /><br />
      We have no idea how you will experience this, though, whether it will be too intense or too much to take in, or perhaps not enough. All we know is that we love it and had to do it, even though everyone called us crazy.
      <br /><br />
      We spent ages trying to get everything to sound, look and feel right. We hope you appreciate this labour of love as it has taken a ridiculous amount of work.

        <h2><u>WHY?</u></h2>
        <p>
          Instead of releasing another 2manydjs mix album, we've tried to come up with something different, a new way to share music we love with you. Besides, we had too many ideas to put into one compilation and too many records to not do something more, something outrageous!
          <br /><br />
          Music is everywhere today and everyone has the tools to be a musician and to be a DJ, but for us as music lovers, that hasn't necessarily resulted in an equally massive explosion of mindblowing new music, so we have decided to go back to all the great little gems we have found over the years, basically a free trip through our ever expanding record collection, into the many boxes we've carried back from record stores in our hometown, or shipped back from all corners of the world.
          <br /><br />
          We're not trying to show off with the rarest holiest of grails that only a handful of people have, but just want to share a bunch of records that you might not have heard yet, and hopefully inspire you to search for and discover them for yourselves.
          <br /><br />
          We grew up surrounded by our dad's extensive record collection and many of our earliest memories are of record sleeves, so it only makes sense that we made this tribute to that forgotten art form, albeit in a very digital way.
          <br /><br />
          What can we say? It seemed like a good idea at the time! We had no idea it was going to take us over 2 years (whilst at the same time touring all over the world) to get it right, and as time went by, we got sucked into it more and more...
          <br /><br />

        <h2><u>WHO?</u></h2>
        <p>
          As you can imagine, we have put a lot of time, money and energy into this project. We've hired people to animate, to encode, to digitize, to scan record sleeves and had to pull a lot of favors everywhere. It has almost bankrupted us, almost killed us, and estranged us from family and friends, but we had to do it.
          <br /><br />
          We have credited everyone involved in specific hours on the respective rear sleeves, but there are a few people who have been with us for the long haul:

          Art Direction : Fergadelic
          <br />
          Executive Producer: Glyn Peppiatt
          <br />
          All-round Musical Assistance: Stefaan Van Leuven
          <br />
